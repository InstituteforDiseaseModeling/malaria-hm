For others:

where are default Garki input files (as in those referenced in the Regression Malaria Garki-02?

For Dan:

-how do I run my first set of sims that is used as the exp_id for the iter0?
-can I just run one iter of OptimTool where the list of params is the same as my Params.xlsx and I make a guess within the same range?
-Why does it ask me for a key to open a Jupyter notebook?
- What is pickling?
